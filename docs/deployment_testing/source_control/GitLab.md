To get the [project access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project\_access\_tokens.html), navigate to your GitLab project settings and create a new token.
- Project access tokens are preferred over personal tokens for security.
- The GitLab **Maintainer** role and **API** access are required.

Finally, navigate back to Datafold and enter the **Project Token** and the name of your **Project** before hitting **Save**.
